# Break-Through-Tech-AI

Here is a collection of my work from my experience at Break Through Tech AI.

Break Through Tech AI is an one year fellowship experience that equips college students with the skills necessary to secure a job in the fastest-growing areas of tech: data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML).

Developed by industry and academic leaders, fellows develop the skills necessary to become a successful machine learning engineer. The AI Program has three key pillars: 

- Machine Learning Foundations Curriculum: Work with industry-relevant tools over the summer to analyze real-world data sets and identify patterns and relationships to create robust data science projects.
  
- AI Studio and Portfolio Development: Tackle real-world ML Challenge Projects in the Fall and Spring AI Studio to develop your professional portfolio with the guidance of academic and industry advisors.
  
- Mentorship and Career Coaching: To support your professional goals, you will work closely with an industry mentor in a small group throughout the course of the program to engage in case studies and skill-building simulations with personalized feedback.

### The Machine Learning Foundations Cirriculum:

- Unit 1: Machine Learning in a Nutshell

- Unit 2: Manage Data in Machine Learning

- Unit 3: Introduction to Model Training

- Unit 4: Train a Linear Model

- Unit 5: Evaluate and Deploy Model

- Unit 6: Ensemble Methods and Unsupervised Learning

- Unit 7: Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing
