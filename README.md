# Break-Through-Tech-AI

Here is a collection of my work from my experience at Break Through Tech AI.

Break Through Tech AI is an one year fellowship experience that equips college students with the skills needed to secure a job in the fastest-growing areas of tech: data science, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML).

Developed by industry and academic leaders, fellows master the skills necessary to become a successful machine learning engineer. The program is split into two parts: The Machine Learning Foundations curriculum over the summer and the AI Studio session that tackles industry projects hosted by leading companies during the academic year. Along the way, fellows learn practical, industry-relevant skills that qualify for entry-level jobs in the field, including building data analysis pipelines and utilizing common ML and AI tools and libraries to train and validate ML models. At the same time, fellows receive career coaching, mentorship, and summer internship placement support, all aimed at successfully launching a career in machine learning and AI.
